    <p class = "half-lifep">Half-Life: Alyx, a new VR game in the Half-Life series, has officially been announced. The new title is described in a tweet as Valve's "flagship" VR title, and will be unveiled on Thursday, November 21 at 10 AM Pacific Time. This has been rumored for some time now, and it appears those rumors are true. Thankfully, we won't have to wait long to find out more, with Valve's reveal now less than an hour away. There's no word regarding a livestream or anything of the sort, but we'll report back with all the details on Alyx as soon as they are shared.</p>

    <p>In August, we found out that a new Saints Row game is being worked on. It was revealed that a new entry in the series was "deep in development," and that it would be a full Saints Row game, not a spin-off. Since then, though, we haven't heard or seen anything else about it. Now, Koch Media CEO Klemens Kundratitz has spoken out about the next game in the series, which is in the works at series developer Volition.</p>

    <p>Bungie says the issues with Destiny 2's servers have been fixed, and players can log in normally to both Destiny 2 and Destiny 1. The developer issued the update on Twitter Friday night, after server issues made it tough to log in or play the game for most of the day.</p>
